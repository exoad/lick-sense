Copyright © [YYYY] [NAMES]
All rights reserved to the above copyright holder(s).

This license, along with its accompanying terms and conditions, is applicable to all forms of the software, including both source and binary versions, regardless of any modifications made. It grants explicit permission for the USE, REPRODUCTION, MODIFICATION, and DISTRIBUTION of the said software.

Please note that this license specifically applies to SOURCE and BINARY software. Any other files or artifacts not directly related to the software, such as "resources," are not covered by this license. To ensure comprehensive protection for such files, they must be designated under a separate license, if necessary. [Refer also to Clause 11].

<h3 align="center"> LICENSE’S TERMS & CONDITIONS: </h3>

## 1. **Retention of Copyright**

Source: Any derivative works that directly modify the original software must absolutely reproduce the copyright notice provided above, along with the entire list of terms and conditions, in an unaltered and complete manner (raw retention).

Binary: Derived binaries compiled by third-party entities must have the capability to reproduce the copyright notices and comprehensive list of terms and conditions mentioned above. This reproduction may be facilitated through accompanying documentation or any other suitable format, providing the end-user with direct access to the precise and unabridged terms and conditions associated with the original software.

It is essential to emphasize that no derivatives of this software, except for files directly related to Clause 11, shall be sublicensed under any circumstances or by any means.

## 2. **Liability**

Under no circumstances shall the authors or copyright holders be held liable for any claims, damages, or other liabilities, whether arising from contract, tort, or any other legal theory, in connection with the software or its use, or any other dealings related to the software.

By accepting this software, you acknowledge and agree that it may be bundled with additional components, which may include, but are not limited to, the following potential issues:

1. Incompatibility with your system(s): The software might not be fully compatible with certain configurations or specifications of your computer system, which could result in performance issues or unexpected behavior.

2. Potential malfunctions: There is a possibility that the software may encounter malfunctions, errors, or glitches during its operation, leading to interruptions or temporary unavailability.

3. Bugs: The software might contain undiscovered bugs or programming errors that could affect its functionality or performance.

It is essential to be aware of these possible challenges and risks associated with the software bundled, and by proceeding with the use or installation of the software, you assume full responsibility for any consequences that may arise from its utilization.

## 3. **Trademarking, Trademarks**

The copyright holders reserve the right to trademark trade names, service marks, trademarks, and/or product names associated with their works, with the exception that such trademarks may be used solely for descriptive purposes when referring to the parent roots or origin of the copyrighted material. In other words, the use of these trademarks is permitted only to identify and describe the original works or their source, and not for any other commercial or competitive purposes that may lead to confusion or misrepresentation. Unauthorized use of these trademarks for purposes other than descriptive titling of the parent roots is strictly prohibited and may result in legal action.

## 4. **Modification via plugin work**

The integration of plugins with the root software is not governed by this license and can be treated as a separate entity. However, if a particular plugin requires the bundling of THIS software in any form or necessitates its presence before the bundled software can link or load the plugin, then this license must be adhered to.

When creating a plugin, it is essential to acknowledge that, regardless of its intended purpose, such software is NOT TRUSTED. By developing potentially adverse or malicious plugins that may be loaded by the bundled software, you expose yourself to potential damages that cannot be addressed under this license or by its stated copyright holders and authors.

Furthermore, it is of utmost importance to emphasize that the program's plugins are strictly prohibited from modifying any resources that would violate the licenses established by the original authors or any licenses connected with THIS software. Unauthorized modifications of such resources are not permissible and may lead to legal consequences.

## 5. **Modification via source work**

Any direct modification of the source software must retain this license in its entirety. Additionally, all versions of the source code must include a separate file titled "ATTRIBUTIONS," which is intended to provide explicit attributions to the relevant works involved. Within this "ATTRIBUTIONS" file, it is permissible to state any changes made to the original software, acknowledge any prior attributions from forks or derivative works, and include your own attribution for the modifications you have made. This "ATTRIBUTIONS" file serves as a clear marker of all attributions associated with the software.

By engaging in the creation and modification of the software, you demonstrate your complete adherence to the terms and conditions set forth in this license. You also acknowledge the inherent risks, responsibilities, and your role as a contributor.

It is essential to emphasize that the "ATTRIBUTIONS" file should not be utilized as a means to restrict access to other contributors or interfere with the overall accessibility of the software and its license. Its sole purpose is to serve as a marker for attributions and should not impose any additional limitations or barriers. If an "ATTRIBUTIONS" file already exists, you may append your attributions to it accordingly.

You pledge that your modifications are safe, reliable, and original. In no way shall your modifications cause adverse/malicious intents (unless it is a bug related to very specific system support or some kind of third-party dependency used by the bundled software). Reliable in the sense that you have tested your modifications against test cases and demonstrated that they will work on the majority of targeted platforms.

## 6. **Source Permissiveness**

The authors and copyright holders reserve the right to restrict access to certain parts of the content. However, such restrictions do not grant you the legal right to modify and redistribute those restricted parts; they may only be modified for personal use.

The bundled software may be used solely as a reference, and you are prohibited from directly restating its contents.

Unless required by applicable law or agreed in writing, content distributed under this license is provided “as is”:

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS,"  WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND INFRINGEMENT.

## 7. **Warranties**

Under this license, there shall be no requirement for any third-party imposed fees or royalties to be paid for any version of the bundled software. Users are not obligated to incur any additional costs beyond the original distribution of the software.

However, it is important to note that plugin authors, who create additional plugins to integrate with the bundled software, may impose their own fees if they deem it necessary. These fees, if applied, are solely at the discretion of the plugin authors and are not mandated by the original copyright holders or this license.

In summary, the bundled software itself remains free of any third-party imposed fees or royalties, but plugin authors retain the right to establish their own fee structures for the plugins they develop.

## 8. **Consumption**

The end user is granted permission to modify, inspect, and redistribute the bundled software, but only in strict compliance with the terms outlined in this LICENSE. By engaging in any activity related to the software, such as executing it, examining its source code or binary form, redistributing it, etc., the end user demonstrates their agreement to abide by this LICENSE.

It is essential to acknowledge that this software may not be flawless and could contain bugs. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the end user to back up their data in case the bundled software requires any data modification during its usage.

When utilizing any built-in plugin loading functionalities, the end user must understand that the original authors and copyright holders do not provide any warranties, liability claims, or protection against any maliciously created plugins. The end user must accept the risks associated with using such plugins and should exercise due diligence in recognizing and understanding potential risks. Any damages caused by third-party plugins loaded by the bundled software can only be addressed by the end user and the respective plugin author(s). The end user is not affiliated with the authors or copyright holders of this license in such cases.

## 9. **Redistribution**

Third-party redistributions and authors may only redistribute under the terms that they:

1. No royalties or fees may be charged.
2. Disclose the full origination.
3. Cannot bar any person or persons from accessing the aforementioned modifications or redistributions.
4. Does not imply or violate the terms and conditions of this license.
5. A full source is disclosed, including the original documentation and source code attributes.

## **10. Patent Claims & License(s)**

This license expressly disclaims any patent claims, and it does not grant any patent claims or rights to users other than the original authors and license holders. Consequently, individuals or entities, apart from the original authors and license holders, are not bestowed with any patent claims or rights pertaining to the software under this license.

It is essential for users to understand that no patent-related privileges are extended to them by this license, and any patent rights related to the software remain the exclusive property of the original authors and license holders. Users must adhere to the terms and conditions of this license without the entitlement to any patent claims or protections.

## **11.   Resource(s)**

This clause applies when the original license holder does not provide an additional license for resources and instead chooses to utilize this license in its entirety to safeguard their work.

It is important to note that this license does not provide comprehensive protection for certain resource files, such as Image Files, Archive Files, and Raw Documents (*.doc, *.docx, *.pdf, etc.).

All works fall under specific subcategories of licenses, and users must be informed and aware of these licenses as designated by the original authors and license holders. In cases where works do not have a separate license, they shall adhere to the following guidelines:

1. Works must be clearly attributed in any derivative works that are created.
2. Derivative works of this software may not modify the mentioned resource files in any way, except for non-content altering changes like file name or file date modifications.
3. Usage of these resource files outside of the bundled software is strictly prohibited unless explicitly stated otherwise. This means you are not allowed to use these resource files for any promotional purposes, whether for the authors & license holders or any other content.
4. Users must acknowledge that these resource files may employ patented file formats or proprietary formats, and they accept the potential legal risks associated with using such formats.
